 SPHERE house scripted dataset: A multi-sensor dataset with annotated activities of daily living recorded in a residential setting v2.0

This dataset expands the original Sphere Challenge dataset with access to a full set of both training and testing data. This dataset is well-adapted for use to predict aspects of the activities of residents within a smart home based only on observed sensor data. An accompanying data descriptor is under submission to Nature Scientific Data.

An updated version was deposited in November 2022 with extensive additional data, as well as being reorganised to facilitate accessibility and reusability.

This dataset is available under the CC-BY licence.
